MiLB Positional Research was done on players in the MiLB from 2014 to 2018. League leaders were taken from the MLB in 2019 and matching names in both dataframes were taken to see if certain MiLB success can be studied to predict a player's success in the majors. This didn't account for defensive actions, so it was biased toward outfielders. 

Takeaways from this project: Alex Jackson, Drew Waters, Christian Pache, and Greg Cullen had similar stats to those that went on to be league leaders in the pros. The code or backtesting missed Contreras, Shewmake, and Langeliers because they were either new prospects from college last year or for Contreras, because he's a catcher who didn't match any of the hitting characteristics (fielding wasn't taken into consideration).
